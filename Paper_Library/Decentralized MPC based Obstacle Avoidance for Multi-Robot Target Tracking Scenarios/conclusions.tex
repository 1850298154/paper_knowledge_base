In this work, we successfully address the problem of obstacle avoidance in the context of decentralized  multi-robot target tracking. Our algorithm uses convex optimization to find collision free motion plans for each robot. We convexify the obstacle avoidance constraints by pre-computing the potential field forces for a horizon and using them as external force inputs in optimization. We show that non-linear dependencies could be converted into such external forces. We validate three methods to avoid field local minima by embedding external forces into the convex optimization. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through gazebo+ROS simulations for various scenarios. Future work involves physically validating the proposed methodology using multiple real robots on different robot platforms (aerial and ground).
