%% Text of abstract
Coordination services and protocols are critical components of distributed systems and are essential for providing consistency, fault tolerance, and scalability. However, due to the lack of standard benchmarking and evaluation tools for distributed coordination services, coordination service developers/researchers either use a NoSQL standard benchmark and omit evaluating consistency, distribution, and fault tolerance; or create their own ad-hoc microbenchmarks and skip comparability with other services. In this study, we analyze and compare the evaluation mechanisms for known and widely used consensus algorithms, distributed coordination services, and distributed applications built on top of these services. We identify the most important requirements of distributed coordination service benchmarking, such as the metrics and parameters for the evaluation of the performance, scalability, availability, and consistency of these systems. Finally, we discuss why the existing benchmarks fail to address the complex requirements of distributed coordination system evaluation.

\section{Evaluation of Current Practices}
\label{S:3}

We have analyzed the existing distributed coordination systems under three main categories: (i) consensus algorithms; (ii) coordination services; and (iii) distributed applications. The relevance, recency, and impact of the systems were considered during the selection process.

{\bf (i) Consensus Algorithms.} These are the low-level algorithms and protocols designed to provide the necessary primitives for distributed coordination. Most of the systems in this category are variations of the original Paxos protocol, with improvements either in performance, availability, or scalability. The systems we have studied under this category include Mencius~\cite{Mencius}, FPaxos~\cite{Flexible-Paxos}, Raft~\cite{RAFT}, Multi-Paxos~\cite{Multi-Paxos}, Hybrid-Paxos~\cite{Hybrid-Paxos}, Egalitarian Paxos (E-Paxos)~\cite{E-paxos}, $M^2$ Paxos~\cite{M2-Paxos}, Bizur~\cite{Bizur}, ZAB~\cite{ZAB}, WPaxos~\cite{WPaxos}, SwiftPaxos~\cite{ryabinin2024swiftpaxos}, Omni-Paxos~\cite{omnipaxos}, and Hydra~\cite{Hydra}. 

{\bf (ii) Coordination Services.} These are high-level services that form a level of abstraction to hide the difficulties in dealing with low-level consensus algorithms and provide the frequently used coordination primitives as a service to the application developers. The systems studied under this category include ZooKeeper~\cite{Zookeeper}, Tango~\cite{Tango}, Calvin~\cite{Calvin}, WanKeeper~\cite{Wankeeper}, ZooNet~\cite{Zoonet}, Boki~\cite{Boki}, FlexLog~\cite{Flexlog}, SplitFT~\cite{SplitFT}, Fabric~\cite{HyperledgerFabric}, and Narwhal~\cite{Narwhal}.

{\bf (iii) Distributed Applications.} The final category consists of distributed applications built on such consensus algorithms or coordination services, each requiring different levels of synchronization, consistency, and availability guarantees. The systems we have studied under this category are: Spanner~\cite{Spanner}, DistributedLog~\cite{DistributedLog}, PNUTS~\cite{PNUTS}, COPS~\cite{COPS}, Cockroach DB \cite{cockroach}, OceanBase~\cite{oceanbase}, and ScalarDB~\cite{ScalarDB}.
