Session types have been originally introduced by \cite{Honda93}.
A session type describes the communication protocol that takes place over a
channel, namely the allowed sequences of input/output actions performed by a
process on that channel. This way it is possible to statically guarantee
some desirable properties of the communication such as 
\emph{protocol fidelity}, \emph{communication safety} 
and \emph{deadlock freedom}. Original session types concerned with
the communication between two entities (\emph{binary}) where each
one owns an endpoint of the channel. 
They have been generalized to \emph{multiparty} 
by \cite{HondaYoshidaCarbone08} to model the interaction between 
multiple participants.
