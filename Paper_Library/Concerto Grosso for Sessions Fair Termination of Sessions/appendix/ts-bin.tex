In this section we discuss the ingredients to obtain a type checking algorithm 
for the type system presented in \Cref{sec:ts_bin_ts}.
In \Cref{ssec:app_min_rank} we show how to compute the \emph{minimum rank of a process} while
in \Cref{ssec:app_algo} we present a variant of the rules in \Cref{fig:ts_bin} that allows
us to obtain a type checking algorithm.
Notably, such algorithm has been implemented in \cite{FairCheck}. The tool
is available on GitHub and contains the codes of most of the examples from 
this thesis as well as from \cite{CicconePadovani22}.
