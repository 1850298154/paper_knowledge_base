In this section we present the proof of \Cref{thm:ts_ll_sound}.
In general, the proof technique follows again that presented in
\Cref{sec:ts_bin_corr,sec:ts_multi_corr}. However, the different scenario
implies different design choices. Hence, we think that it is worth 
showing a more detailed sketch of the proof of \Cref{thm:ts_ll_sound} by introducing
the main intermediate results and by relating them to \muMALL. 
Then, as in \Cref{sec:ts_bin_corr,sec:ts_multi_corr}, we present all the detailed proofs.
