In this section we define syntax and reduction semantics of \piLIN, a variant of
the linear $\pi$-calculus \citep{KobayashiPierceTurner99} in which all channels
are meant to be used for \emph{exactly} one communication. The calculus supports
(co)recursive data types built using units, pairs and disjoint sums. These data
types are known to be the essential ingredients for the encoding of sessions in
the linear
$\pi$-calculus \citep{Kobayashi02b,DardhaGiachinoSangiorgi17,ScalasDardhaHuYoshida17}.
