In this section we present the typing rules for \piLIN.
%
As usual we introduce typing contexts to track the type of the names occurring
free in a process. A \emph{typing context} is a finite map from names to types
written $x_1 : S_1, \dots, x_n : S_n$. We use $\CtxC$ and $\CtxD$ to
range over contexts, we write $\dom\Ctx$ for the domain of $\Ctx$ and
$\Ctx,\CtxD$ for the union of $\Ctx$ and $\CtxD$ when
$\dom\Ctx \cap \dom\CtxD = \emptyset$.
%
Typing judgments have the form $\qtp\Ctx{P}$ and we say that $P$ is \emph{quasi
typed} in $\Ctx$.
For the time being we say ``quasi typed'' and not ``well typed'' because some
infinite derivations using the rules in \Cref{ssec:ts_ll} are invalid.
Well-typed processes are quasi-typed processes whose typing derivation satisfies
some additional validity conditions that we detail in \Cref{ssec:ts_ll_wtp}.
