In this section we define the calculus for multiparty sessions on which we apply
our static analysis technique. The calculus is an extension of the one presented
by \cite{CicconePadovani22} to multiparty sessions in the
style of \cite{ScalasYoshida19} and that has been presented in \cite{CicconeDP22}.
%
We recall some basic notions.
We use an infinite set of \emph{variables} ranged over by $x$, $y$, $z$, an
infinite set of \emph{session names} ranged over by $s$ and $t$, a set of
\emph{roles} ranged over by $\rolep$, $\roleq$, $\roler$, a set of \emph{message
tags} ranged over by $\Tag$, and a set of \emph{process names} ranged over by
$A$, $B$, $C$. As in the binary case, the different terminology for labels 
is needed to avoid confusion with the labels in \Cref{sec:st}.
%
We use roles to distinguish the participants of a session. In particular, an
\emph{endpoint} $\ep\sn\role$ consists of a session name $\sn$ and a role
$\role$ and is used by the participant with role $\role$ to interact with the
other participants of the session $s$.
%
We use $u$ and $v$ to range over \emph{channels}, which are either variables or
session endpoints.
%
We write $\seqof x$ and $\seqof u$ to denote possibly empty sequences of
variables and channels, extending this notation to other entities.
%
We use $\Pol$ to range over the elements of the set $\set{\iact,\oact}$ of
\emph{polarities}, distinguishing input actions ($\iact$) from output actions
($\oact$).
