In this section we describe the main definitions of the library. 
Concerning the meta-theory, the reader can refer to \Cref{sec:gis}.
Notably, we first present an approach mimicking meta-rules. Then we introduce
the notions of \emph{interpretations} and we prove the \emph{principles}.
At last, we formalize the examples we presented in \Cref{sec:gis}.
