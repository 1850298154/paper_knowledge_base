As noted in \Cref{rm:agda_st}, we rely on a different definition of (binary) session types
with respect to that presented in \Cref{sec:st}. 
Although such choice has been originally motivated by the fact that we tried to simplify
as much as possible the Agda mechanization of the properties (\Cref{sec:agda_ft,sec:agda_fc,sec:agda_fs}),
it also has the capability of encoding \emph{dependent} session types, that is,
types that depend on previously exchanged messages. We give more
details later. We first introduce the new formulation of (binary) session types
and then we detail the technical aspects of their formalization.
