In this section we characterize fair termination of a session type
according to its general formulation in \Cref{thm:fair_termination}.
We say that a session type is fairly terminating if it preserves the possibility
of reaching $\Win$ or $\End[\In]$ along all of its transitions that do not lead to
$\TNil$.  Fair termination of $S$ does not necessarily imply that there exists an
upper bound to the length of communications that follow the protocol $S$, but it
guarantees the absence of ``infinite loops'' whereby the communication is forced
to continue forever.
