The notions of compliance given in \Cref{sec:agda_fc} induce
corresponding semantic notions of subtyping that can be used to define a safe
substitution principle for session types \citep{LiskovWing94}. Intuitively, $\S$
is a subtype of $\T$ if any client that successfully interacts with $\S$ does so
with $\T$ as well. 
The reader may look at \Cref{ch:fs} for more details about \emph{fair subtyping}.
