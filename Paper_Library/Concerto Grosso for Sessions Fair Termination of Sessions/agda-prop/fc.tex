In this section we define and characterize two \emph{compliance} relations for
session types, which formalize the ``successful'' interaction between a client
and a server connected by a session. The notion of ``successful interaction''
that we consider is biased towards client satisfaction, but see
\Cref{rm:asymmetry} for a discussion about alternative notions.
