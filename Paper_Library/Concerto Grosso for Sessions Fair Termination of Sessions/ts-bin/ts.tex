In this section we present the type system for binary sessions that we introduced in \Cref{sec:ts_bin_proc}.
%
Before looking at the typing rules we motivate, through a series of examples, the key properties enforced by the type system that, 
taken together, guarantee fair termination. There are two families of problems that can compromise fair termination.
%
First of all, the process (or part thereof) may be unable to reduce further but is not $\Done$. 
In our model, this can happen for many reasons, for example: a process attempts at sending a 
tag on a session that the receiver is not willing to accept; a process attempts at sending a 
termination signal when the receiver expects a channel; the processes at the two ends of the same 
session are both waiting for a message from that session. These are all examples of \emph{safety violations}, 
which are prevented by any ordinary session type system. 
%
In \Cref{ssec:boundedness} we focus instead on \emph{liveness violations}. Roughly
speaking, liveness is violated when a process (or part thereof) engages an
infinite computation that cannot possibly terminate.
