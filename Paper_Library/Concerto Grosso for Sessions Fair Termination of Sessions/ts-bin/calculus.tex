In this section we introduce the calculus for binary sessions.
We recall some basic notions.
We use an infinite set of \emph{channel names} ranged over by $x$, $y$, $z$,
a set of \emph{message tags} ranged over by $\Tag$, and a set of \emph{process names} ranged over by
$A$, $B$, $C$.
%
We write $\seqof x$ for a possibly empty sequences of
channels, extending this notation to other entities and 
we use $\Pol$ to range over the elements of the set $\set{\iact,\oact}$ of
\emph{polarities} to distinguish input actions ($\iact$) from output actions
($\oact$).
