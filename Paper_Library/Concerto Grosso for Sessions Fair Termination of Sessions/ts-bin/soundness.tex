In this section we detail the proof of \Cref{thm:ts_bin_sound}.
The most intriguing aspect in such proof is that a
closed, well-typed process admits a reduction sequence to $\Done$.
%
The proof technique is related to the \emph{method of helpful directions} \citep{Francez86}:
we define a well-founded \emph{measure} for (well-typed) processes and we prove
that this measure decreases strictly as the result of ``helpful'' reductions.
In our case, the measure of a (well-typed) process $P$ is a lexicographically
ordered pair $(m, n)$ of natural numbers such that $m$ is an upper bound to the
number of sessions that $P$ may need to create and of weights of casts that $P$ may need to
perform \emph{in the future} in order to terminate, whereas $n$ is the
cumulative efforts to terminate the sessions that $P$ has created \emph{in the past} and that
are not terminated yet. 
We account for this effort by measuring the shortest reduction that terminates a
compatible session (\Cref{def:compatibility}).
Notably, a session terminates by \refrule{rb-close}; a cast is
performed when it is absorbed by the corresponding restriction, namely by
\refrule{sb-cast-new}.

We first show two standard results, that is, typing is preserved by structural
precongruence and reduction.
Then, we formally introduce the measure and we characterize some \emph{normal forms} that we
need in order to achieve the proof that such measure reduces by following the right
reductions.
