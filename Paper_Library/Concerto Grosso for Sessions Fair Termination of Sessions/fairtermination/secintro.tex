The decomposition of a distributed program into sessions enables its
modular static analysis and the enforcement of useful properties through a type
system. Examples of such properties are \emph{communication safety} (no message
of the wrong type is ever exchanged), \emph{protocol fidelity} (messages are
exchanged in the order prescribed by session types) and \emph{deadlock freedom}
(the program keeps running unless all sessions have terminated). These are all
instances of \emph{safety properties}, implying that ``nothing bad'' happens. In
general, one is also interested in reasoning and possibly enforcing
\emph{liveness properties}, those implying that ``something good'' happens
\cite{OwickiLamport82}. Examples of liveness properties are \emph{junk freedom}
(every message is eventually received), \emph{progress} (every non-terminated
participant of multiparty a session eventually performs an action) and \emph{termination}
(every session eventually comes to an end).
