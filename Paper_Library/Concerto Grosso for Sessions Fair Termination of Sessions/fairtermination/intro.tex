Among the properties mixing safety and liveness aspects in the context of session types, we decided
to develop type systems enforcing \emph{fair termination}. Such property is desirable for many reasons. 
Indeed, as we briefly mentioned at the beginning of the thesis, a lock free session
does not imply that other sessions are lock free as well. On the other hand, if we consider a session and 
we assume that all the other ones are fairly terminating, we can conclude that the one under analysis is
fairly terminating as well.

In \Cref{sec:ft_intro} we describe the property and we relate it with other properties that are
frequently studied in the literature. 
In \Cref{sec:ft_formally} we formally define \emph{fair termination}
in its general form on \emph{reduction systems} such that it 
will be instantiated in the different session type based scenarios
in \Cref{sec:ft_st}.
%
%In \Cref{pt:type_systems} we will treat \emph{fair termination} from three point of views. 
%First, in \Cref{ch:ft_binary} we will show a type system for binary sessions.
%In \Cref{ch:ft_multiparty} we will generalize such type system to the multiparty context.
%At last, in \Cref{ch:ft_ll} we will study fair termination in a linear logic inspired scenario. 
Notably, in \Cref{pt:agda} we will provide a characterization of fair termination based on generalized
inference systems (\Cref{sec:gis}) and we will provide a mechanization of both its definition
and correctness proofs in Agda.
