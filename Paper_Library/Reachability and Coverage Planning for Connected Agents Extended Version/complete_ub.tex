The following result relies on the fact that the communication constraints are
trivial this class.

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:cc:ub:breach}
    \pbBReachCC is in LOGSPACE.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    From Lemma \ref{lemma:boundedUSTCONNinLOGSPACE}, one can construct an
    algorithm in LOGSPACE for \pbBReachCC. Indeed, given a configuration $c$ and
    $\ell\in\mathds{N}$, the straightforward iteration on the locations $c_i$
    followed by the verification of a path of at most $\ell$ (given in unary) steps from
    $\basenode$ to $c_i$ yields a sound and complete algorithm for \pbBReachCC.
\end{proof}
