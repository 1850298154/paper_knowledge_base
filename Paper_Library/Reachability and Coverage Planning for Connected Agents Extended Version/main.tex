\begin{abstract}
	Motivated by the increasing appeal of robots in information-gathering missions,
	we study multi-agent path planning problems in which the agents must remain
	interconnected. We model an area by a topological graph specifying the movement
	and the connectivity constraints of the agents. We study the theoretical
	complexity of the reachability and the coverage problems of a fleet of connected
	agents on various classes of topological graphs.
	We establish the complexity of these problems on known classes, and introduce a new class
        called \emph{sight-moveable graphs}
        which admit efficient algorithms.
	% We show that deciding the existence of a covering plan is PSPACE-complete.
	% Additionally, we show that this complexity holds in a reasonable subclass of
	% topological graphs called the neighbor-communicable topological graphs. We
	% identify a realistic but restrictive subclass, the class of sight-moveable
	% topological graphs, on which the reachability and the coverage problems are in
	% LOGSPACE. However, the corresponding optimization problems of the makespan of
	% such plans remain NP-complete on all classes of topological graphs defined in
	% this work, except the complete-communication case in which the bounded
	% reachability falls in LOGSPACE.
