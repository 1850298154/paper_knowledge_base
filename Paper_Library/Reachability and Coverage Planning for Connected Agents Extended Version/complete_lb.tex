Our NP lower bound proof of the \pbBCoverageCC problem is by reduction from
the grid Hamiltonian cycle (G-HC) problem which is the Hamiltonian cycle problem
restricted to grid graphs and is NP-complete~\cite{Itai:1982}.
%\todo{What is a grid graph?}

% \begin{definition}[G-HC] The grid Hamiltonian cycle problem is the following
%   decision problem:
% %  \begin{itemize}
% %  \item[] Input:
%   Given a grid graph $G=\langle V,E \rangle$,
% %  \item[] Output:
%     decide if there is a simple cycle $t$ in $G$ which contains all vertices?
%     %such that
%     %all $v\in V$ are seen only once in $t$?
% %    does there exist a tour $t$ in $G$, that is a path such that
% %    all $v\in V$ are seen only once in $t$?
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{definition}

%\begin{theorem}
%  G-HC problem is NP-complete \cite{Itai:1982}.
%\end{theorem}
%Our result is by reduction from G-HC:
\begin{theorem} \label{prop:cc:lb:bcover}
  \label{th:cc:compl:bcover}
  \pbBCoverageCC is NP-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  The upper bound follows from Proposition~\ref{prop:dir:ub:bcover-breach}.
  
  We give a polynomial-time reduction from the G-HC problem.
  Consider a graph~$G=\langle V, E\rangle$, an instance of~G-HC.
  %We describe
  %the construction of an instance of \pbBCoverageCC from a G-HC instance below.

  Consider the sight-moveable topological graph %\linebreak[4] 
  $G'=\langle V,
  \moves, \coms\rangle$ with $\moves~=E$ and $\coms=V\times V$ and associate a
  single agent and the bound~$|V|$ to the \pbBCoverageCC instance.
  We call a simple cycle containing all vertices a \emph{tour}.
  We prove that there exists a tour $t$ in $G$ iff there exists a
  covering execution of length $|V|$ in $G'$.

  ($\Rightarrow$) Any tour of~$G$ is a valid execution satisfying
  \pbBCoverageCC since the communication edges form a complete graph,
  and the bound is~$|V|$.

  ($\Leftarrow$) Let us suppose that we have an execution of length $|V|$
  which covers the graph $G'$. The execution starts and ends at $\basenode$
  and
  visits all nodes in $|V|$ steps. Hence, the execution visits all nodes only
  once and is a cycle in the graph.

  
\end{proof}
\else
The upper bound follows from Proposition~\ref{prop:dir:ub:bcover-breach}. The
  NP-hardness proof is given in the long version.
