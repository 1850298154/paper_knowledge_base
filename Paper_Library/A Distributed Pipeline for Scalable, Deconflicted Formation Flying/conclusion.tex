We presented a unified formation flying pipeline with distributed formation control and task assignment solutions that run onboard the vehicles and uses VIO for localization. 
Our ADMM solver addressed the scalability issue of general solvers for obtaining formation gains and the auction-based algorithm generated non-conflicting assignment solutions in a computationally efficient manner. 
Simulation and hardware tests demonstrated formation convergence in \SIrange[range-units=single,range-phrase=--]{96}{100}{\percent} of cases that gridlocked when assignment was not used.
Noteworthy future extensions include incorporating an assignment strategy that considers vehicle dynamics to minimize the total \textit{predicted} distance traveled, and addition of distributed pose graph optimization to obtain consistent VIO pose estimates.
