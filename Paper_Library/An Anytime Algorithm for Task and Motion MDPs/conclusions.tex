\section{Conclusions}
 

Our experiments showed that
starting with an imprecise model, refining it based on the
information required to evaluate different courses of action is an
efficient approach for the synthesis of high-level policies that are consistent with constraints that may be imposed by aspects of the model that are more abstract or imprecise. While full models of realistic problems can overwhelm SDM solvers due to the uncountable branching factor and long time horizons, our hierarchical approach allows us to use SDM solvers while addressing more realistic problems involving physical agents.
