\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

This paper showed that combining CP solving of structural constraints and ML understanding of vague notions (like meaning) on the task of \tg obtains promising results.

This paper presents GenCP, a new method that extends \otf to make the domains manageable by LLM predictions.
The results show that GenCP can generate meaningful sentences that ensure various properties like the number of words, number of characters, mandatory keywords, or some forbidden characters. The results also show that GenCP has 100\% satisfaction rate and takes less time to output solutions of the same quality than a well-known technique in the field of text generation under constraints: Beam Search. 
GenCP provides multiple improvements thanks to ordering, enforcing variability and perplexity, allowing thus to obtain overall higher quality solutions than BS.
