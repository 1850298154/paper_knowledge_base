Constraint Programming (CP) and Machine Learning (ML) face challenges in text generation due to CP's struggle with implementing ``meaning'' and ML's difficulty with structural constraints. This paper proposes a solution by combining both approaches and embedding a Large Language Model (LLM) in CP. The LLM handles word generation and meaning, while CP manages structural constraints. This approach builds on 
%
GenCP, an improved version of On-the-fly Constraint Programming Search (OTFS) using LLM-generated domains.
Compared to Beam Search (BS), a standard NLP method, this combined approach
%
(GenCP with LLM)
is faster and produces better results, ensuring all constraints are satisfied. This fusion of CP and ML presents new possibilities for enhancing text generation under constraints.
