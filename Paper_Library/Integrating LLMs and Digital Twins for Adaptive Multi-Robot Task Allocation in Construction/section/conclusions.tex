\section{Conclusions}
This research introduced an integrated framework for adaptive multi-robot task allocation in dynamic construction environments, combining digital twin technology, IP optimization, and LLM-driven narrative interpretation. The proposed system addresses the challenges posed by real-time uncertainties, enabling efficient and flexible task rescheduling without manual intervention. By decoupling the reasoning and optimization processes, the framework maintains algorithmic transparency and scalability, offering a structured yet flexible solution adaptable to evolving site conditions. Empirical evaluations demonstrated the computational robustness of the optimization model. They also showed that LLMs can effectively extract constraint modifications from unstructured natural language descriptions with high accuracy.
 The establishment of a closed-loop feedback mechanism between the physical construction site and its digital twin representation further enhances situational awareness and supports continuous system adaptation.
Future work will focus on extending the framework to more complex human-robot collaboration scenarios and expanding its application beyond construction to domains such as manufacturing, logistics, and industrial assembly in dynamic environments.
