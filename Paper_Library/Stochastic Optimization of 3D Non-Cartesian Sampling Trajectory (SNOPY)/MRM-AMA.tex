\abstract{
\section{Purpose} 
Optimizing 3D k-space sampling trajectories
for efficient MRI
is important yet challenging.
This work
proposes a generalized framework
for optimizing 3D non-Cartesian sampling patterns via 
data-driven optimization.

\section{Methods} 
We built a differentiable MRI system model to enable
gradient-based methods for
sampling trajectory optimization.
By combining training losses,
the algorithm can simultaneously
optimize multiple properties of sampling patterns,
including image quality, 
hardware constraints (maximum slew rate and gradient strength),
reduced peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS),
and parameter-weighted contrast.
The proposed method can either
optimize the gradient waveform
(spline-based freeform optimization)
or optimize properties of given sampling trajectories
(such as the rotation angle of radial trajectories).
Notably, the method optimizes sampling trajectories
synergistically with either model-based 
or learning-based reconstruction methods.
We proposed several strategies to alleviate
the severe non-convexity and huge computation demand
posed by the high-dimensional optimization.
The corresponding code is organized
as an open-source, easy-to-use toolbox.

\section{Results}
We applied the optimized trajectory to multiple applications
including structural and functional imaging.
In the simulation studies,
the reconstruction PSNR of a 3D kooshball trajectory
was increased by 4 dB with SNOPY optimization.
In the prospective studies,
by optimizing the rotation angles of a stack-of-stars (SOS) trajectory,
SNOPY improved the PSNR by 1.4 dB compared to the best empirical method.
Optimizing the gradient waveform of a rotational EPI trajectory
improved subjects’ rating of the PNS effect from ‘strong’ to ‘mild.’

\section{Conclusion} SNOPY provides an efficient data-driven 
and optimization-based method
to tailor non-Cartesian sampling trajectories.}
