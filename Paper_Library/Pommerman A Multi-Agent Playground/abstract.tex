We present Pommerman, a multi-agent environment based on the classic console game Bomberman. Pommerman consists of a set of scenarios, each having at least four players and containing both cooperative and competitive aspects.
%, making it a rich test bed for multi-agent reinforcement learning.
We believe that success in Pommerman will require a diverse set of tools and methods, including planning, opponent/teammate modeling, game theory, and communication, and consequently can serve well as a multi-agent benchmark.
To date, we have already hosted one competition, and our next one will be featured in the NIPS 2018 competition track.
