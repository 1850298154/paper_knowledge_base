\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have introduced the Pommerman environment, detailed why it is a strong setup for multi-agent research, and described early results and competitions.

All of the code is readily available at our git repository (github.com/MultiAgentLearning/playground) and further information about competitions, including NIPS 2018, on our website (pommerman.com).
