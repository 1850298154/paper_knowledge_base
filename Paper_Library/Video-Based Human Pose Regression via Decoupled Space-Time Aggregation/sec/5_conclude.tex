\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a novel and effective regression framework for video-based human pose estimation. Through the proposed Decoupled Space-Time Aggregation network (DSTA), we efficiently leverage temporal dependencies in video sequences for multi-frame human pose estimation, while reducing computational and storage requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over image-based regression methods as well as heatmap-based methods, opening up new possibilities for real-time video applications.
