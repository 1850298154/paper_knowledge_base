As Problem P1 is combinatorial in its nature, it invariably requires a series of reformulations before it may be solved efficiently. Moreover, while the objective function of P1 is separable, as $\|\mathbf x\|_{2,0}=\sum_{i\in\mathcal V}\|\mathbf x[i]\|_{2,0}$, the equality constraint of P1 introduces a coupling between the blocks of $\mathbf x$,
preventing P1 from being separable between the agents in $\mathcal V$. In \cite{blumensath2013compressed}, an algorithm based on Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) was proposed for solving P1; however, it requires a high-dimensional projection operation that is infeasible for large-scale multi-agent applications.

In this section, we develop a distributed algorithm for solving P1 by using a combination of the sequential convex programming (SCP) and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) techniques. 
Additionally, we exploit the structure of the graph (which is encapsulated by Assumption \ref{ass:jacobian}) to ensure that computational and communication costs of the resulting algorithm do not scale with the size of the graph.
