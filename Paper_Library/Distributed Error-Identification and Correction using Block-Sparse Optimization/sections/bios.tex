{Shiraz Khan} received his MS degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Purdue University in 2020, and his Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from IIT Madras in 2018. He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree at Purdue University, as part of which he investigates the problems of robustness, resilience, and scalability of state estimation. The potential applications of his Ph.D. research include decentralized and cyberattack-resilient state estimation in single and multi-agent scenarios.
One of his current research interests is in exploring and leveraging the underlying structure (such as sparsity, geometry, and/or symmetry) of various control theory and signal processing applications.

{Inseok Hwang} received the Ph.D. degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Stanford University, and is currently a professor in the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics and a university faculty scholar at Purdue University. His research interests lie in high assurance autonomy (which guarantees safety, security and performance) for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) based on the hybrid systems approach and its applications to safety critical systems such as aircraft/spacecraft/unmanned aerial systems (UAS), air traffic management, and multi-agent systems, which are complex systems with interacting cyber (or logical or human) elements and physical components. For his research, he leads the Flight Dynamics and Control/Hybrid Systems Laboratory at Purdue University. He received various awards, including the National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER award in 2008, recognition as one of the nation’s brightest young engineers by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in 2008, the AIAA Special Service Citation in 2010, the University Faculty Scholar by Purdue university in recognition of outstanding scholarship in 2017, Outstanding Graduate Faculty Mentor award 2018, and the C.T. Sun Award in recognition of excellence in research in 2019. He is an Associate Fellow of AIAA and a member of IEEE Control Systems Society and Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society. He is currently an associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems.
