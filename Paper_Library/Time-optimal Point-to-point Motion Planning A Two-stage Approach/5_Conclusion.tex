\section{Conclusion}\label{Sec_V}
We propose a two-stage approach to formulate the time-optimal point-to-point motion planning problem. 
The corresponding time-optimal OCP formulated using this two-stage approach features a fixed and low number of control steps for computational manageability.
In the first stage, it uses a fixed time grid corresponding to the control sampling time, preempting interpolation errors.
To handle fluctuating and delayed computation times in solving the time-optimal OCP, which exceed one control sampling time, we integrate the two-stage approach with the ASAP-MPC update strategy, facilitating online replanning. 
Numerical examples of autonomous navigation with collision avoidance demonstrate this integration and highlight the advantages of the two-stage approach over other alternative approaches in the literature.
The subject of further work is the implementation of the two-stage approach on embedded systems, in particular autonomous mobile robots, for real-world time-optimal motion planning tasks.
