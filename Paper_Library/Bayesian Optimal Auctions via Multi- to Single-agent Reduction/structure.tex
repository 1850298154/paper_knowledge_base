In Section~\ref{sec:prelim} we describe single- and multi-agent
mechanism design problems.  In Section~\ref{sec:single-agent} we give
algorithms for solving two kinds of single-agent problems: multi-item
unit-demand preferences and private-value private-budget preferences.
In Section~\ref{sec:alg}, we give a high-level description of the
multi- to single-agent reduction which allows for efficiently compute
optimal mechanisms for many service based environments.  The key step
therein, an efficient algorithm that implements any jointly feasible
set of interim allocation rules, is presented in
Section~\ref{sec:inter}.  This section is divided into three parts
which address single-unit, multi-unit, and matroid feasibility
constraints, respectively.  Conclusions and extensions are discussed
in Section~\ref{sec:conc}.
