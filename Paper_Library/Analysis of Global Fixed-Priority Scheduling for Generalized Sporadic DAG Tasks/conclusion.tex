\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we consider constrained-deadline, parallel DAG tasks scheduled under 
a preemptive, G-FP scheduling algorithm on multiprocessor platforms. 
We propose a new technique for bounding carry-out workload 
of interfering task by converting the calculation of the bound to an optimization problem, 
for which efficient solvers exist. The proposed technique applies directly to general DAG tasks. 
The optimal solution value for the 
optimization problem serves as a safe and tight upper bound for carry-out workload. 
We present a response-time analysis for G-FP based on the proposed workload bounding technique. 
Experimental results affirm the dominance of the proposed approach over existing techniques. 
There are a couple of open questions that we would like to address in future. They include 
bounding carry-in and carry-out workloads for the actual number of processors $m$ of the system and 
designing an efficient priority assignment scheme for parallel DAG tasks scheduled under G-FP algorithm.
