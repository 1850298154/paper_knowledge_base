\section{Conclusion}\label{sec.Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose an AoI-based networking middleware that enables the customization of WiFi networks to the needs of time-sensitive applications that rely on multi-agent systems. By controlling the storage and flow of information in the underlying WiFi network, the middleware can prevent packet collisions and dynamically prioritize transmissions aiming to optimize information freshness. The middleware is implemented at the application layer, facilitating customization and integration to existing systems %such as \cite{KivaWiFi,VehicleToInfrastructureDSRC,AppLevelDSRC,NYCDOT,CERBERUS,SAR,DistributedRobotFormation,CooperativeSLAM,ASTRO,DroneCinema,DOOR-SLAM,RobotFormation,MultiRobotSlam,MultiRobotMapping}. 
To demonstrate the benefits of our middleware, we implement a mobility tracking application using a swarm of sensing-UAVs communicating with a central controller via WiFi. Our experimental results show that our middleware can improve information freshness and, as a result, tracking accuracy by \emph{more than one order of magnitude} when compared to an equivalent system that uses plain WiFi. Our flight tests also show that the middleware improves scalability of the mobility tracking application. Interesting extensions of this work include consideration of a distributed middleware architecture.
