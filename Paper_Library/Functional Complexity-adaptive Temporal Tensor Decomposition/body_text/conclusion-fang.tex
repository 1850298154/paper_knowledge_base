\section{Conclusion}
We have presented \textsc{Catte}, a complexity-adaptive model for functional temporal tensor decomposition. \MODEL\ automatically infers the underlying rank of temporal tensors with continuously indexed modes, while achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance and capturing interpretable temporal patterns efficiently. A current limitation of our work is the lack of explicit incorporation of physical laws into the modeling process. In future work, we plan to integrate \textsc{Catte} with domain-specific physical knowledge, enabling more accurate long-range and wide-area physical field reconstructions.





%Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate its effectiveness.
