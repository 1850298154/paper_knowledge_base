This paper focuses on the broadcast of information on
robot networks with stochastic network interconnection topologies.
Problematic communication networks are almost
unavoidable
in areas where we wish to deploy multi-robotic systems,
usually due to a lack of environmental consistency,
accessibility, and structure.
We tackle this problem by modeling the broadcast
of information in a multi-robot communication network as a stochastic process with random arrival
times, which can be produced by irregular robot movements,
wireless attenuation, and other environmental factors.
Using this model, we provide and analyze a receding horizon control
strategy to control the statistics of the information broadcast.
The resulting strategy compels the robots to re-direct their
communication resources to different neighbors according to
the current propagation process 
to fulfill global broadcast
requirements. Based on this method, we provide an approach to compute the expected time to broadcast the
message to all nodes. 
Numerical examples are provided to
illustrate the results.
