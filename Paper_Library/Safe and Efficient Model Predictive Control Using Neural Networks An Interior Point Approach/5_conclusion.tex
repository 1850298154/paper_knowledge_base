\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we provided an efficient way of exploring the interior of the MPC feasible set for learning-based approximate explicit MPC, and demonstrated the performance and computational gains that can be achieved by approaching the problem from the interior. The paradigm relies on a Phase I solution that exploits the structure of the MPC problem and a Phase II solution that features a projection-free feasibility guarantee. The results compare favorably against common approaches that use unsupervised learning, as well as against the oracle itself used in supervised approaches. Future work includes applications to MPC problems with convex but non-polytopic constraint sets, and to distributed settings.
