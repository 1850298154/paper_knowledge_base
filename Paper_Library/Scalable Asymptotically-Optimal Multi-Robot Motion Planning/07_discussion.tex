This work studies the asymptotic optimality of sampling-based
multi-robot planning over implicit structures.  The objective is to
efficiently search the composite space of multi-robot systems while
also achieving formal guarantees. This requires construction of
asymptotically optimal individual robot roadmaps and appropriately
searching their tensor product. Performance is further improved by
informed search in the composite space.

These results may extend to more complex settings involving
kinodynamic constraints by relying on recent
work~\cite{ELM15a,ELM15b}.  Furthermore, the analysis may be valid for
different cost functions other than total distance. The tools
presented here can prove useful in the context of simultaneous task
and motion planning for multiple robots, especially
manipulators \cite{Dobson:2015_MAM}.
