Discovering high-quality paths for multi-robot problems can be
achieved, in principle, through asymptotically-optimal data structures
in the composite space of all robots, such as a sampling-based roadmap
or a tree. The hardness of motion planning, however, which depends
exponentially on the number of robots, renders the explicit
construction of such structures impractical. This work proposes a
scalable, sampling-based planner for coupled multi-robot problems that
provides desirable path-quality guarantees.  The proposed \drrtstar\
is an informed, asymptotically-optimal extension of a prior
method \drrt, which introduced the idea of building roadmaps for each
robot and implicitly searching the tensor product of these structures
in the composite space.  The paper describes the conditions for
convergence to optimal paths in multi-robot problems.  Moreover,
simulated experiments indicate \drrtstar\ converges to high-quality
paths and scales to higher numbers of robots where various
alternatives fail. It can also be used on high-dimensional challenges,
such as planning for robot manipulators.
