We show that it is NP-complete to compute makespan-optimal solutions for the generalized sliding-tile puzzle (\gstp). We further establish matching asymptotic makespan lower and upper bounds for \gstp for all possible numbers of escorts, and provide concrete constants for all makespan upper bounds. In ongoing and future work, we are examining (1) computing optimal solutions for other objectives for \gstp, (2) related variations of the \gstp formulation, and (3) developing practical algorithms for computing different optimal solutions for large-scale \gstp instances.
