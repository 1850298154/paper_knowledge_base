\begin{abstract}
In the $15$-puzzle game, $15$ labeled square tiles are reconfigured on a $4\times 4$ board through an escort, wherein each (time) step, a single tile neighboring it may slide into it, leaving the space previously occupied by the tile as the new escort. We study a generalized sliding-tile puzzle (\gstp) in which (1) there are $1+$ escorts and (2) multiple tiles can move synchronously in a single time step. Compared with popular discrete multi-agent/robot motion models, \gstp provides a more accurate model for a broad array of high-utility applications, including warehouse automation and autonomous garage parking, but is less studied due to the more involved tile interactions.
In this work, we analyze optimal \gstp solution structures, establishing that computing makespan-optimal solutions for \gstp is NP-complete and developing polynomial time algorithms yielding makespans approximating the minimum with expected/high probability constant factors, assuming randomized start and goal configurations.
%In this work, we analyze \gstp's optimality structure and establish that (1) computing makespan-optimal solutions for \gstp is NP-complete and (2) assuming a randomized start and goal configurations for the labeled tiles, polynomial time algorithms are developed yielding makespans matching that of the expected minimum possible makespan, asymptotically. 
%Grid Multi-robot Path Planning (MRPP) has been extensively studied, but much less is known about the corner-following constraint (CFC) variant, which has applications ranging from automated garages to grocery packing warehouses.
%On an $m_1 \times m_2$ grid, the problem has a tight upper and lower bound for the makespan objective when there are $\Theta(m_1 m_2)$ escorts, but there is a gap when there are only $\Theta(m_1 + m_2)$ or $\Theta(1)$ escorts.
%In addition, nothing is known about the intractability of this problem or its related variants.
%In this work, we close the gap for an arbitrary number of escorts, finding an expected constant factor algorithm when there are at most $\min(m_1, m_2)$ escorts and a high probability constant factor algorithm when there are more.
%We also show that the problem is NP-hard under the makespan objective, and by the same reduction, standard grid MRPP is NP-hard also, unifying the two grid MRPP makespan hardness results.
%In addition, we show that when there is a single escort, the two colored variant and partial variant are both NP-hard, which significantly impact the design of efficient systems using the MRPP with CFC paradigm.
%These results contribute to our understanding of the design of efficient algorithms from both an upper and lower bound perspective.
