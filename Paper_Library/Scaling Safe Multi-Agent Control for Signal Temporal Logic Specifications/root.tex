\title{Scaling Safe Multi-Agent Control for Signal Temporal Logic Specifications}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

% NOTE: authors will be visible only in the camera-ready and preprint versions (i.e., when using the option 'final' or 'preprint'). 
% 	For the initial submission the authors will be anonymized.

\begin{abstract}
  % We present a scalable approach to multi-agent control for Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications. 
  % We propose a novel method that combines a multi-agent collision avoidance controller
  % with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based planner trained on an STL objective
  % to generate safe and efficient plans for multiple agents. 
  % Our approach uses an end-to-end differentiable technique with the STL robustness metric to optimize for the satisfaction of complex temporal specifications given a controller with multi-agent collision avoidance capabilities.
  % We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a range of STL specifications and show that our method can scale to a large number of agents and complex specifications.
  % Our experiments show that our approach outperforms existing methods that use a purely single-agent view or a state-of-the-art MILP-based planner in terms of scalability and performance.

Existing methods for safe multi-agent control using logic specifications like Signal Temporal Logic (STL) often face scalability issues. This is because they rely either on single-agent perspectives or on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)-based planners, which are complex to optimize. These methods have proven to be computationally expensive and inefficient when dealing with a large number of agents. To address these limitations, we present a new scalable approach to multi-agent control in this setting. Our method treats the relationships between agents using a graph structure rather than in terms of a single-agent perspective. Moreover, it combines a multi-agent collision avoidance controller with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based planner, models the system in a decentralized fashion, and trains on STL-based objectives to generate safe and efficient plans for multiple agents, thereby optimizing the satisfaction of complex temporal specifications while also facilitating multi-agent collision avoidance. Our experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods that use a state-of-the-art MILP-based planner in terms of scalability and performance.
