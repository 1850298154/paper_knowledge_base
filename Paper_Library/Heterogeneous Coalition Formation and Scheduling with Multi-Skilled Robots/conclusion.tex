\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we presented an approach to task allocation in heterogeneous multi-robot systems. Our problem combines coalition and scheduling of a heterogeneous swarm of multi-skilled robots. Our problem formulation also includes stochastic aspects of travel between any two tasks. We proposed two methods to solve this problem. The first produces an optimal solution at the expense of long run-times. This method is onsly suitable for small-scale problems where optimality is required. Our second proposed method uses a greedy approach and it quickly produces sub-optimal solutions.

We compared the performance of the two methods. We found that the greedy solver is typically between 2x the cost of the optimal solution, but it offers speedups in the order of $10^{5}$ with respect to the optimal solver. Further, the greedy solver can tackle large-scale scenarios (32 robots, 64 skills, and 1,024 tasks) in less than a minute. This makes the greedy solver a viable option for quick but best-effort decision-making.

In future work, we aim to improve the performance of the greedy solver by using better heuristics. We also aim to make the system decentralized to promote parallelism.
