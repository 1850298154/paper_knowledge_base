  Overview of our approach. (a) We aim to find a collision-free path for a rigid body from its current configuration $q_t$ to the goal configuration $q_g$. (b) We assume no prior knowledge about the scene and represent obstacles by points and normals sampled on object surfaces. (c) Our neural network learns the PointNet encoding of observed points and normals together with the motion policy. (d) The learned network generates actions that move the body towards the goal configuration along a collision-free path.
