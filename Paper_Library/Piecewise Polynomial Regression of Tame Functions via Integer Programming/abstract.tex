Tame functions are a class of nonsmooth, nonconvex functions,  
which feature in a wide range of applications: functions encountered in the training of deep neural networks with all common activations, 
 value functions of mixed-integer programs, or wave functions of small molecules.
We consider approximating tame functions with piecewise polynomial functions.  
We bound the quality of approximation of a tame function by a piecewise polynomial function with a given number of segments on any full-dimensional cube.
We also present the first mixed-integer programming formulation of piecewise polynomial regression.
Together, these can be used to estimate tame functions.
We demonstrate promising computational results.
