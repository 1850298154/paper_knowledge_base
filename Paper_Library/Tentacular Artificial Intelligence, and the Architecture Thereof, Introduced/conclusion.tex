We have introduced Tentacular AI, and a number of architectural
elements thereof, and are under no illusion that we have accomplished
more than this.  At AEGAP 2018, we will demonstrate TAI in action in
both the scenarios sketched above; implementation is currently
underway.  Despite the nascent state of the TAI research program, we
hope to have provided a promising, if inchoate, overview of tentacular
AI --- an overview which, given the centrality of highly expressive
languages for novel planning and reasoning, we hope is of interest to
some, maybe even many, at this dawn of the ``internet of things'' and
its vibrant intersection with AI.
