CMP demonstrates that strict FIFO ordering, high throughput, and memory
safety can coexist in lock-free queue design. CMP eliminates UAF and ABA
by construction rather than via complex validation protocols, while
maintaining competitive performance across contention regimes. While CMP
already achieves scalability, a segmented variation---similar to
Moodycamel's---could further increase scalability under extreme
contention, while preserving CMP's correctness guarantees and automatic
recovery properties.
