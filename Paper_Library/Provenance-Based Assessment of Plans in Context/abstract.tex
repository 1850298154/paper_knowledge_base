%TODO -- introduce the problem.
Many real-world planning domains involve diverse
information sources, external entities, and variable-reliability agents, all of which may impact the confidence, risk, and sensitivity of plans.
Humans reviewing a plan may lack context about these factors; however, this information is available during the domain generation, which means it can also be interwoven
into the planner and its resulting plans. %such that this information can be available alongside the plan.

This paper presents a provenance-based approach to explaining automated plans.
Our approach (1) extends the \shop HTN planner to generate dependency information, (2) transforms the dependency information into an established PROV-O representation, and (3) uses graph propagation and TMS-inspired algorithms to support dynamic and counter-factual assessment of information flow, confidence, and support.
We qualified our approach's explanatory scope with respect to explanation targets from the automated planning literature and the information analysis literature, and we demonstrate its ability to assess a plan's pertinence, sensitivity, risk, assumption support, diversity, and relative confidence.
