% heuristics

We build a baseline system which concentrates on the two enhanced UD phenomena which are very straightforward to implement using simple heuristic rules, namely, co-reference in relative clauses and modifier relations containing case markers.
These rules are applied to the output of the basic parser. We have two versions of the modifier relation rule - one in which the value of the \texttt{case} morphological feature is included in the relation label and one without. We also have a rule which adds the lemma of a conjunction to the enhanced label of its head. 
%We experiment with various combinations of these heuristics for each treebank.
For each development set, we find the optimal subset of the set of heuristic rules in terms of ELAS among all possible subsets except those combining the two case rules.

This baseline system is clearly suboptimal since it makes no attempt at all to handle those more interesting enhanced UD phenomena which involve the addition or deletion of arcs, i.e. conjunct propagation, ellipsis and control/raising constructions.
Nonetheless it is useful as a baseline to check that the main system
is performing reasonably and is available as a fall back.
