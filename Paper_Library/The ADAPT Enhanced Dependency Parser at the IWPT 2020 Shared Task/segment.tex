% section: segmentation

We use UDPipe\footnote{\url{http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe}}
\citep{straka-strakova-2017-tokenizing}
with off-the-shelf UD v2.5 models\footnote{\url{http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-3131}}
\cite{straka-strakova-2019-universal}
for the languages of the shared task
to split the raw input text into sentences and tokens.
In cases where more than one UDPipe model is available for
a language, we try all models
during development
\footnote{Due to a configuration error, we did not try
    segmentation with UDPipe models trained on
    \texttt{fi\_ftb}, \texttt{lt\_hse} and
    \texttt{sv\_lines} in the official submission.
}
and select for each test language
the best overall pipeline according to ELAS
on the treebank with the biggest development set
for the language.\footnote{For
    Czech, we based our decision on results for \texttt{cs\_cac}
    instead of \texttt{cs\_pdt} as we did not have full results available for \texttt{cs\_pdt}.
