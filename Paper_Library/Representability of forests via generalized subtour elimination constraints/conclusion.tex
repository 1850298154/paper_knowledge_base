\section{Concluding remarks}

In this work, we presented the first characterization of the families of forests that can be represented with GSECs. Building on this result, we generalized the framework of Ghosal et al.~\cite{ghosal2024} for VRPs and derived a GSEC-based formulation for the robust capacitated minimum spanning tree (RCMST) problem. Beyond extending previous results, our findings demonstrate the versatility of GSECs as a modeling tool for a broad class of network design and vehicle routing problems. An interesting direction for future research is to investigate the computational performance of our proposed formulation for the RCMST under different choices of uncertainty sets.
