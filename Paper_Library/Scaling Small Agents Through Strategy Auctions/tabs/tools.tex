        \texttt{ask\_search\_agent} &
        Delegates a natural-language query to a web search agent and returns its response. \\

        \texttt{inspect\_file\_as\_text} &
        Reads a file from the workspace as markdown text and returns its contents for subsequent inspection and reasoning \\
        \cmidrule(lr){1-2}
        \texttt{final\_answer} &
        Submits the agent's final solution and terminates the episode. \\

        Python environment &
        Executes Python code for calculations, data manipulation, and lightweight scripting; it is preconfigured with the standard library and commonly used packages sufficient to solve the
        benchmark tasks. \\
