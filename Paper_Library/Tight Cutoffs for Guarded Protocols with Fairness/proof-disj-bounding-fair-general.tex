\begin{proof}
Again, an inspection of the proof of Lemma~\ref{disj:le:FairDisjunctiveBounding} shows that it works almost without modification if we replicate the local run of $A^1$ along with $k$ local runs of copies of $B$, instead of only $A^1, B^1$. In particular, the rest of the flooding construction and the interleaving construction do not have to be changed.
\end{proof}
