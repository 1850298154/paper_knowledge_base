\begin{proof}
Given a unconditionally-fair initializing run $x$ of $\largesys$, we construct a unconditionally-fair initializing run $y$ in $(A,B)^{(1,n+1)}$, with one additional process $p$. 
First, copy all local runs of all processes of $(A,B)^{(1,n)}$ from the run $x$ into $y$.
Then, let process $p'$ stutter in $\init$ until some other process $p \neq B_1$ enters $\initstate$. 
Then, exchange the roles of processes $p'$ and $p$: let $p$ stutter in $\initstate$, while $p'$ takes the transitions of $p$ from the original run, until it enters $\initstate$. And so on.
In this way, we continue to interleave the run between $p'$ and $p$, and obtain a unconditionally-fair initializing run for all processes, with $y(A,B_1)=x(A,B_1)$. 
Thus, if $\largesys \models \pexists h(A,B_1)$, then $(A,B)^{(1,n+1)} \models \pexists h(A,B_1)$.
