}
Let $c=2\card{B}$. Given an unconditionally-fair run $x$ of a system $\largesys$ we construct an unconditionally-fair run $y$ of the cutoff system $\cutoffsys$ such that $y(A,B_1)\simeq x(A,B_1)$.

The construction of $y$ can be separated into four parts, three of which are 
modifications of constructions seen in the previous lemmas:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Flooding Construction}: We construct from $x$ a pseudo-run $
\yflood$ of $\cutoffsys$ with i) $\yflood(A,B_1) = x(A,B_1)$, ii) 
\emph{two} witness processes for every $q \in \visited_\inf(x)$, and iii) one witness 
process for every $q \in \visited_\fin(x)$.
	\item \emph{Evacuation Construction}: 
	Like in the proof of Lemma~\ref{le:disj:deadlocks}, we need to ensure that 
witness processes for states from $\visited_\fin(x)$ will leave their states. In 
this case, this is necessary because otherwise we cannot guarantee that they will 
be able to move infinitely often. Let $\yevac$ be the resulting pseudo-run, and let 
$\pref$ be the first moment such that in $\yevac[\pref:\infty]$ 
all processes except $A$ and $B_1$ are only in states from $\visited_\inf(x)$.
 
  \item \emph{Fair Extension}:
The fair extension turns the pseudo-run $\yevac$ into a unconditionally-fair pseudo-run $\yfair$.
The idea stems from the observation that in the original run $x$ of $\largesys$, all processes move infinitely often, and thus every local run must contain at least one loop.
To obtain a unconditionally-fair pseudo-run, we let all processes except $A$ and $B_1$ move along such loops after the moment $\pref$, while ensuring the property that there is always at least one process in every state from $\visited_\inf$.

  \item Interleaving Construction: takes the unconditionally-fair pseudo-run from the previous step and turns it into the desired unconditionally-fair run of $\cutoffsys$.
 
\end{enumerate}
