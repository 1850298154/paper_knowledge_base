Given a subset $\mF \subseteq \mB$
%\footnote{In this section we will use only $\mP_1 = \{B_1\}$, 
%          but for the case of deadlocks we will need a set.

%          from $x$ to $y$ later in the proof.} 
and an infinite run $x=(s_1,e_1,p_1)\ldots$ of \largesys, 
define
\begin{align}
& \visInf{\mF}{x} = \{ q \|\! \exists \text{ infinitely many } ~~~~ m\!:  
s_m(B_i) = q 
\text{ for some } B_i \in \mF \} \label{disj:def_vinf_wrt} \\
& \visFin{\mF}{x} = \{ q \|\! \exists \text{ only finitely many } m\!:  
s_m(B_i) = q
\text{ for some } B_i\in \mF \} \label{disj:def_vfin_wrt}
\end{align}
%
Let $q \in \visFin{\mF}{x}$.
In run $x$ there is a moment $f_q$ when $q$
is reached for the first time by some process from $\mF$, denoted $B_{\first_q}$. 
Also, in run $x$ there is a moment $l_q$ such that:
$s_{l_q}(B_{\last_q})=q$ for some process $B_{\last_q} \in \mF$, 
and $s_t(B_i)\neq q$ for all $B_i \in \mF$,
$t > l_q$ 
--- i.e., when some process from $\mF$ is in state $q$ for the last time in $x$. 
Then, saying that process $B_{i_q}$ of \cutoffsys 
\emph{floods $q \in \visFin{\mF}{x}$ and then evacuates into $\visInf{\mF}{x}$} 
means: 
$$
y(B_{i_q}) = x(B_{\first_q})\slice{1}{f_q} \ \cdot\ (q)^{(l_q - f_q + 1)} \cdot \ 
x(B_{\last_q})\slice{l_q}{m} \ \cdot \ (q')^\omega,
$$
where $q'$ is the state in $\visInf{\mF}{x}$ that $x(B_{\last_q})$ reaches first, 
at some moment $\time \geq l_q$.
In words, process $B_{i_q}$ mimics process $B_{\first_q}$ until it reaches $q$, 
then does nothing until process $B_{\last_q}$ starts leaving $q$, 
then it mimics $B_{\last_q}$ until it reaches $\visInf{\mF}{x}$.

The construction ensures: 
if we copy local runs of all processes not in $\mF$ from $x$ to $y$, 
then all transitions of $y$ are enabled. 
This is because: 
for any process $p$ of $\cutoffsys$ that takes a transition in $y$ at any moment, 
the set of states visible to process $p$ is a superset of the set of states 
visible to the original process in \largesys whose transitions process $p$ copies.
