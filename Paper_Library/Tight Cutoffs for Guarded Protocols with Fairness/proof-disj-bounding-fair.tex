\sj{for weak or strong fairness, the same construction can be used; evacuation is not necessary, but also doesn't increase the cutoff if we use it; difficulty: show that cutoff is still tight
}
Let $c=2\card{B}$. 
Given an unconditionally-fair run $x$ of $\largesys$ 
we construct an unconditionally-fair run $y$ of the cutoff system $\cutoffsys$ 
such that $y(A,B_1)$ is stuttering equivalent to $x(A,B_1)$.

Note that in $x$ there is a moment $m$ such that all local states that are visited after $m$ are in $\visInf{\mB}{x}$.

The construction has two phases. In the first phase, we apply flooding for states in $\visInf{\mB}{x}$, and flooding with evacuation for states in $\visFin{\mB}{x}$:
\li
\-[(a)] $y(A)=x(A)$, $y(B_1)=x(B_1)$

\-[(b)] for every $q \in \visInf{B_2..B_n}{x} \smi \visInf{B_1}{x}$, 
       devote two processes of $\cutoffsys$ that flood $q$

\-[(c)] for some $\qstar \in \visInf{B_2..B_n}{x} \cap \visInf{B_1}{x}$,
       devote one process of \cutoffsys that floods $\qstar$

\-[(d)] for every $q \in \visFin{B_2..B_n}{x}$, 
       devote one process of $\cutoffsys$ that 
       floods $q$ and evacuates into $\visInf{B_2..B_n}{x}$

\-[(e)] let other processes (if any) mimic process $B_1$
\il
The phase ensures that at moment $m$ in $y$, 
there are no processes in $\visFin{\mB}{x}$, 
and all the pre-requisites of the fair extension are satisfied.

The second phase applies the fair extension, 
and then establishes the interleaving semantics 
as in the bounding lemma in the non-fair case.
The overall construction uses up to $2|B|$ copies of $B$.
% Indeed: 
% fin&smi=0, fin&cap=0,
% smi = InfB2..Bn - cap
% InfB2..Bn <= B - fin
% Then:
% 1+2smi+1cap+1+fin <= 1+2(InfB2..Bn-cap)+cap+1+fin = 
%                      2+2InfB2..Bn-cap-fin <=
%                      2+2B-cap-fin
% now split case:
% everywhere fin>0 (otherwise 2|B| follows from the analysis of the fair extension)
% note: if cap=0, then we actually have (recall fair pre)
%       1+2smi+fin =< 1+2(B-InfB1-fin)+fin = 1+2B-2InfB1-2fin =< 2B-3
% thus cap>0,fin>0
% then 2+2B-cap-fin =< 2B
