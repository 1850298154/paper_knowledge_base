\begin{proof}
We can again use the templates from the previous observation, with a formula $h(A^1,B^{(n)}) = \pexists \bigwedge_{i \in [1..n]} (\eventually b^i_3 \land \eventually\always (b^i_2 \land a^1_{end}))$.\footnote{The case of $n=0$ can be shown with a simpler templates: $A$ is the template with only one state $a_{end}$ without successors, and $B$ is the chain that ends in $b_k$ with the self guarded loop.}
\end{proof}
