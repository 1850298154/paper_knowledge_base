\begin{proof}
Given an unconditionally-fair [initializing] run $x$ of $\largesys$ with $n>c$ construct an unconditionally-fair [initializing] run $y$ in the cutoff system $(A,B)^{(1,1)}$: copy the local runs of processes $A$, $B_1$.
%  and copy the behaviour of a process of $\largesys$ that moves infinitely often in the run $x$. Since $y$ is the result of removal of a number of local runs from $x$, it is an unconditionally-fair initializing run of $\cutoffsys$.
\end{proof}
