\begin{proof}\ak{remove this proof -- it is kahlon's result and does not have monotonicity.., we have a similar proof in the next theorem}
The result follows from the original proof for global deadlock detection by Emerson and Kahlon~\cite[Lemma 5.2]{Emerson00}. The construction uses two local runs for every $\state \in \stateset_B$ to ensure the global deadlock. We note that processes in the initial state never contribute to a deadlock because of the special form of conjunctive guards. Therefore, it is enough to consider two local runs for every $\state \in \stateset_B \setminus \{\initstate\}$, and the cutoff is $2\card{B}-2$.
