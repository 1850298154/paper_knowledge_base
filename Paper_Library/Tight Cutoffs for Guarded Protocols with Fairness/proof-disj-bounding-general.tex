\begin{proof}
An inspection of the proof of Lemma~\ref{disj:le:NonFairDisjunctiveBounding} shows that it works almost without modification if we replicate the local run of $A^1$ along with $n$ local runs of copies of $B$, instead of only $A^1, B^1$. In particular, the rest of the flooding construction and the interleaving construction do not have to be changed.

Additionally, one can observe that the cutoff is independent of whether the property talks about $A^1$ or not.
\end{proof}
