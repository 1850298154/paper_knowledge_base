\section{Conclusion}

Through a diverse set of demonstrations, we have shown that ESM represents a widely applicable computation graph and trainable module for tasks requiring general spatial reasoning. When compared to other memory baselines for image-to-action learning, our module outperforms these dramatically when learning both from ego-centric and scene-centric images. One weakness of our method is that is assumes the availability of both incremental pose measurements of all scene cameras, and depth measurements, which is not a constraint of the other memory baselines. However, with the ever increasing ubiquity of commercial depth sensors, and with there being plentiful streams for incremental pose measurements including visual odometry, robot kinematics, and inertial sensors, we argue that such measurements are likely to be available in any real-world application of embodied AI. We leave it to future work to investigate the extent to which ESM performance deteriorates with highly uncertain real-world measurements, but with full uncertainty propagation and probabilistic per pixel fusion, ESM is well suited for accumulating noisy measurements in a principled manner.
