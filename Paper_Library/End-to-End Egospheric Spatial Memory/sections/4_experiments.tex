\section{Experiments}

The goal of our experiments is to show the wide applicability of ESM to different embodied 3D learning tasks. We test two different applications:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Image-to-action learning for multi-DOF control (Sec \ref{sec:multi_dof_visuomotor_control}). Here we consider drone and robot manipulator target reacher tasks using either ego-centric or scene-centric cameras. We then assess the ability for ESMN policies to generalize between these different camera modalities, and assess the utility of the ESM geometry for obstacle avoidance. We train policies both using imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL).
\item Object segmentation (Sec \ref{sec:obj_seg}). Here we explore the task of constructing a semantic map, and the effect of changing the ESM module location in the computation graph on performance.
\end{enumerate}
