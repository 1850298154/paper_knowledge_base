\begin{abstract}
This work presents an extension to the MoveIt2 planning library supporting asynchronous 
%(i.e., uncoordinated) 
execution for multi-robot/multi-arm robotic setups. The proposed method introduces a unified way for the execution of both synchronous and asynchronous trajectories by implementing a simple scheduler and guarantees collision-free operation by continuous collision checking while the robots are moving. 
%We also propose a suitable test apparatus to benchmark the proposed system w.r.t the state-of-the-art synchronous execution method.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
In this paper we introduced an extension to allow MoveIt2 to support multi-arm / multi-robot asynchronous trajectory execution.
Through a simulated pick and place scenario of two 7 DoF Panda arms in a shared workspace (see Figure \ref{fig:platforms}), we are currently running experiments that are 1) demonstrating the correct functioning of the implementation and collision avoidance logic; 2) proving the advantage of this approach with respect to synchronous execution for specific workloads; and 3) measuring the overhead induced by the backlog and re-planning logic.

% Ongoing work is collecting experimental results to: 1) validate the implementation and collision avoidance logic, 2) demonstrate advantages with respect to multi-arm synchronous execution for specific workloads; and 3) measure the overhead induced by the backlog and re-planning logic.
% Preliminary results show that collision avoidance works as expected in a simulated scenario with two 7 DoF Panda arms sharing the entire workspace, incurred overhead is limited and not significant when compared to synchronous arm execution delay for longer combinations of robotic tasks.
