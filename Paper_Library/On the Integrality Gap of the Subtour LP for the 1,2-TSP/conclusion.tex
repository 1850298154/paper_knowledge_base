\section{Conjectures and conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}


As stated in the introduction, we conjecture the following.
\begin{conj} \label{conj:12tsp-gap}
The integrality gap of the subtour LP for the 1,2-TSP is $\tfrac{10}9$.
\end{conj}

Schalekamp, Williamson, and van Zuylen~\cite{SchalekampWvZ11} have conjectured that 
to determine the integrality gap for the subtour LP, we can restrict ourselves to considering instances, which have an optimal solution that is an extreme point of the F2M polytope. 

% That is, the worst-case ratio for the subtour LP occurs for costs $c$ such that an optimal subtour LP solution for $c$ is the same as an optimal fractional 2-matching for $c$. Schalekamp et al.\ call such costs $c$ {\em fractional 2-matching costs} for the subtour LP.
% \begin{conjecture}[Schalekamp et al.~\cite{SchalekampWvZ11}] \label{conj:tsp}
% The integrality gap for the subtour LP is attained for a fractional 2-matching cost for the subtour LP.
% \end{conjecture}
We have shown in Theorem~\ref{thm:tour76} that if an analogous conjecture is true for 1,2-TSP, then the integrality gap for 1,2-TSP is at most $\tfrac 76$; it would be nice to show that if the analogous conjecture is true for 1,2-TSP then the integrality gap is at most $\tfrac{10}9$.


Finally, we remark that the integrality gap of the linear program obtained by adding the constraints
\[\sum_{e\in\delta(S)\backslash F} x(e) + \sum_{e\in F} (1-x(e)) \ge 1 \quad \forall S \subset V,\ F\subseteq \delta(S),\ |F| \mbox{ odd},\]
to (\SUBT) is at most $\tfrac{11}9$ by (\ref{eq:PY}) and Lemma~\ref{lem:PYsubt}, since the 2M polytope is described by these additional constraints plus the degree constraints.
It is an interesting question whether the analysis of Berman and Karpinski~\cite{BermanK06} can also be expressed in terms of the optimal value of this stronger LP.
