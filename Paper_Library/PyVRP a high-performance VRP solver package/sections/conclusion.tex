\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduce PyVRP, an open-source Python package for solving the vehicle routing problem with time windows, and show numerically that PyVRP achieves excellent performance on this problem variant.
The package has minimal dependencies and can easily be installed in pre-compiled format from the Python package index.
The package's implementation is flexible, and can easily be extended with new solution techniques and vehicle routing problem variants.
Our hope is that PyVRP facilitates furthering the state-of-the-art in VRP solving by enabling researchers \added{and practitioners} to easily and quickly build on a state-of-the-art solver.
