\section*{Data and Software Availability Statement}

The artifact developed for this work is available~\cite{artifact}, which contains all source codes and experimental data necessary to
reproduce our evaluation in~\cref{sec:experiments}, excluding the results of \seqc. 




%We provide an artifact~\cite{artifact} which contains all source codes and experimental data necessary to
%reproduce our evaluation in~\cref{sec:experiments}, excluding the results of \seqc. 
%In particular, source codes of the tools \SyncPDOffline and \SyncPDOnline as well as all the benchmarks used in our evaluations are provided. 
%The compared techniques \dirk~\cite{Kalhauge2018}, and DeadlockFuzzer~\cite{Joshi2009} are also included. 
%The artifact contains scripts that fully automate the process of reproducing~\cref{tab:expr-results} and~\cref{tab:expr-dlf-results}.
%Instructions on the usage of these scripts and customization of the evaluation are also provided with the artifact.
