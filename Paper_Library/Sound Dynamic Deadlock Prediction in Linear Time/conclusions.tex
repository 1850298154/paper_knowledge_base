\section{Conclusion}
\seclabel{conclusions}
We have studied the complexity of deadlock prediction and
introduced the new tractable notion of sync-preserving deadlocks,
along with sound, complete and efficient algorithms
for detecting them. 
Our experiments show that the majority of deadlocks occurring in practice are indeed sync-preserving, and our algorithm $\SyncPDOffline$ is the first deadlock predictor that achieves 
sound and high coverage, while also spending only linear time to process its input.
Our online algorithm $\SyncPDOnline$ enhances the bug detection
capability of controlled concurrency testing techniques like~\cite{Joshi2009},
at close runtime overheads.
Interesting future work includes incorporating static checks~\cite{bigfoot2017}
%, lifting the sync-preserving notion to generalized deadlocks~\cite{Joshi2010}, 
and
exploring ways for deeper integration of controlled concurrency testing
with predictive techniques.
Another step is to extend the coverage of sync-preserving deadlocks while maintaining efficiency, for example, by reasoning about program control flow.

%Another concrete step is to incorporate sync-preserving deadlocks in a fuzzing environment, such as~\cite{Joshi2009}.
%We will take up on this challenge in the near future.
