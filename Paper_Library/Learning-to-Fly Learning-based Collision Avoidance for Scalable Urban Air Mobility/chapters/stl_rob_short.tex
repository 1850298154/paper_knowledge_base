\subsection{Robustness of STL specifications}
\label{sec:stl_rob_short}

%For a time domain $\TDom = [0:dt:T]$ (with sampling time $dt$), 
%For a time domain $\TDom = \{0, dt, 2dt,\ldots, T\}$ where $dt$ is a sampling time,
For a time domain $\TDom = [0, T]$ with sampling time $dt$,
the signal space $\SigSpace$ is the set of all signals $\sstraj: \TDom \rightarrow X$. The \textit{Robustness} value \cite{FainekosP09tcs} $\rho_\formula$ of an STL formula $\formula$, with respect to the signal $\mathbf{x}$ that it is defined over, is a real-valued function of $\mathbf{x}$ that has the important following property:

\begin{theorem} \cite{FainekosP09tcs}
	\label{thm:rob objective new}
	For any $\sstraj \in \SigSpace$ and STL formula $\formula$, 
	if $\robf(\sstraj) <0$ then $\sstraj$ violates $\formula$, and if $\robf(\sstraj) > 0$ then $\sstraj$ satisfies $\formula$. 
	The case $\robf(\sstraj) =0$ is inconclusive.
\end{theorem} 
Intuitively, the degree of satisfaction or violation of a specification is indicated by the robustness value.
%Optimization based algorithms which maximize the robustness value have been developed for control and planning  with STL specifications \cite{pant2017smooth,Raman14_MPCSTL}.
For simplicity, the  distances are defined in the inf-norm sense. 
This, combined with Theorem \ref{thm:rob objective new} gives us the following result:
%This property has been used in methods for control and planning with STL specifications \cite{pant2017smooth,Raman14_MPCSTL}, where optimization based algorithms are developed to find state trajectories that maximize this robustness value to ensure satisfaction of the specification. 
%We assume for simplicity, that the specifications in this paper are defined over the positions of the UAS and distances are in the inf-norm sense. 
%This, combined with Theorem \ref{thm:rob objective new} gives us the following result:
\begin{corollary}
\label{cor:rob_tube}
Given a discrete-time trajectory $\sstraj$ such that $\sstraj \models \formula$ with robustness value $\rho>0$, then any trajectory $\mathbf{x}'$ that is within $\rho$ of $\sstraj$ at each time step, i.e. $||x_t-x_t'||_\infty < \rho \, \forall t \in \TDom$, is such that $\mathbf{x}' \models \formula$ (also satisfies $\formula$).
\end{corollary}

%For our framework, this implies that if the trajectory generator, given mission specification $\formula$, creates a trajectory $\sstraj$ with robustness $\rho$, then the controller must ensure that actual trajectory $\mathbf{x}'$ must be within $\rho$ of the planned trajectory $\sstraj$. We refer to this concept as the \textit{robustness tube} and fig. \ref{fig:dronetube} shows a visualization for it for the timed-reach avoid problem of example \ref{ex:reach_avoid_exmp}.
