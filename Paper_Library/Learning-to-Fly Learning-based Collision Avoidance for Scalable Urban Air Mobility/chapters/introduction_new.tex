\section{Introduction}

%1st paragraph on how the two central issues with UTM is mission planning with safety and performance guarantees and collision avoidance. Describe each and say that the problem with UTM is harder than ATC because there is no central authority to monitor and enforce drone safety and the density is at least an order of magnitude higher than what TCAS was designed for.
%[TCAS II was designed to operate in traffic densities of up to 0.3 aircraft per square nautical mile (nmi), i.e., 24 aircraft within a 5 nmi radius, which was the highest traffic density envisioned over the next 20 years. REF- https://www.faa.gov/documentlibrary/media/advisory_circular/tcas%20ii%20v7.1%20intro%20booklet.pdf]

The development of safe and reliable UAS Traffic Management (UTM) is necessary to enable Urban Air Mobility (UAM) \cite{NAP25646}. The two fundamental issues here are: a) mission planning for UAS fleets with guarantees on 
safety and performance, and b) real-time airborne collision avoidance (CA) methods so UAS run by different operators can share the airspace without a priori approval of all flight plans. Tackling the planning and inter-UAS collision avoidance jointly yields a computationally intractable problem as the number of UAS in the airspace increase \cite{pant2018fly, SahaRSJ14}. So we separate these two aspects in a manner where individual UAS (or those in the same fleet) plan independently, which in turn requires an approach for runtime collision avoidance. The scalability of this will be essential in UAM applications as there will be no central authority to monitor and enforce UAS safety for hundreds of drones per square mile. This stands in contrast to the existing Air-Traffic Control and collision avoidance methods for commercial aviation, like TCAS-II, which was designed to operate in traffic densities of up to 0.3 aircraft per square nautical mile (nmi), i.e., 24 aircraft within a 5 nautical mile radius, which was the highest traffic density envisioned over the next 20 years \cite{TCAS}.

%2nd paragraph on the challenge with airborne collision avoidance - complexity, runtime, etc. Not specific to MILP. Start with "Airborne collision avoidance is a complex problem."
Airborne collision avoidance however is a complex problem. With high-speed UAS operating at low altitudes in cluttered urban airspace, decisions for collision avoidance need to be made within fractions of a second. The CA system must also be able to take into account the environment (e.g. buildings and other infrastructure, altitude limits, geofenced areas etc.) around it, making the problem harder than simply avoiding inter-UAS collisions. 
%For this reason, even the state-of-art collision avoidance method for UAS, ACAS-Xu \cite{ACASXu}, is only being envisioned for use in high-flying large UAS like the MQ4C Triton \cite{MQ4C}.
%, although a variant for small UAS (ACAS-sXu) is also under development.

%3rd paragraph - the two problems you solve here - take this from the start of Section II. It belongs here.

%In this paper, we aim to develop a framework for UAS traffic management (UTM) that overcomes the limitations outlined above and solves the following two problems (which will be formalized in later sections):

To overcome the limitations outlined above, we aim to solve the following problems: %our primary focus is on solving:

\begin{myprob}
\label{prob:traj_STL_highlevel}
\textbf{Independent trajectory planning} for an individual UAS (or fleets run by the same operator) to satisfy spatial, temporal and reactive mission objectives specified using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), independently of other UAS that could be in the airspace.
\end{myprob}
%\textcolor{green}{ Independent or decentralized?}

\begin{myprob}
\label{prob:CA_highlevel}
\textbf{Real-time pairwise predictive airborne collision avoidance} such that UAS mission requirements satisfied by the trajectories obtained by solving problem \ref{prob:traj_STL_highlevel} are not violated, e.g. UAS make it to their destinations in time while avoiding collisions with each other.
\end{myprob}

%We build upon existing work \cite{pant2018fly} to also solve:


%4th paragraph - further details on MILP-based solution and why your approach is needed.

%Executing collision avoidance on-demand, instead of pre-flight, allows us to develop a trajectory generation approach to solve problem \ref{prob:traj_STL_highlevel}. 

%We use a variant of the method in \cite{pant2018fly} which employs Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to capture mission specifications and synthesize UAS trajectories with safety and performance guarantees. 
The airborne collision avoidance (Problem \ref{prob:CA_highlevel}) poses a larger challenge, and is the primary focus here. 
%We start by formulating a Mixed Integer Program to solve the two UAS collision problem in a cooperative manner. 
%While fundamentally sound, the solution cannot run in real-time (see Section \ref{sec:experiments}), and also requires the optimization to be solved centrally.
% Consequently, as the primary contribution of this work, we develop a two-stage decentralized collision avoidance method to overcome these limitations.

%This method consists of a learning-based conflict resolution scheme, and a cooperative decentralized Model Predictive Controller (MPC) to carry out the collision avoidance by actuating the UAS.
%Section \ref{sec:overview} gives an overview of the approach. Sections \ref{sec:learning} presents the two learning-based collision resolution schemes developed in this paper, and section \ref{sec:CA_control} covers the distributed Collision Avoidance MPC (CA-MPC) controllers that run on board the UAS. Extensive simulations are carried out in section \ref{sec:experiments} to show the 

%Contributions
%It will really help to give the two approaches easy names. This will be good for the abstract and intro too.You have three contributions
%1. and 2. two learning-based collision avoidance schemes - Clearly state the benefits of your approaches here.
%2. CA-MPC
%You need to define Robustness here. You cannot use that word without defining it.

\caption{\small Step-wise explanation and visualization of the framework. Each UAS generates its own trajectories to satisfy a mission expressed as a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specification, e.g. regions in green are regions of interest for the UAS to visit, and the obstacle corresponds to infrastructure that all the UAS must avoid. When executing these trajectories, UAS communicate their trajectories to others in range to detect any collisions that may happen in the near future. If a collision is detected, the two UAS execute a conflict resolution scheme that generates a set of additional constraints that the UAS must satisfy in order to avoid the collision. A co-operative CA-MPC controls the UAS in order to best satisfy these constraints while ensuring each UAS's STL specification is still satisfied. This results in new trajectories (in solid blue and pink) that will avoid the conflict and still stay within the pre-defined robustness tubes.}
