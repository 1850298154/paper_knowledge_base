\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:exp_setup}










%A test set of 10K random, conflicting trajectories were generated by 
%using the minimum-jerk trajectory generation algorithm 
%from~\cite{pant2018fly}.
%The time horizon was set to $T=4$s and $dt=0.1$s. Thus, each 
%trajectory consists of $N+1=41$ time-steps. 
%The initial and final waypoints were sampled from the standard normal 
%distribution, initial velocities were set to zero and the 
%collision point was fixed to be $(1,1,1)$. 
%An example trajectory is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:scen1_w_ca}.
