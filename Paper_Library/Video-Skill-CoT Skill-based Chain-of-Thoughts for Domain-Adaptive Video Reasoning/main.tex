% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\section*{Limitations}
Our proposed framework demonstrates strong video reasoning capabilities, generating fine-grained, domain-adaptive rationales based on required skills.
However, it may still produce occasional inaccuracies or hallucinations~\cite{liu2023mitigating, wang2024mitigating, zhou2024analyzing} in its text outputs.
Additionally, the overall performance is influenced by the underlying pre-trained backbones, namely, the LLM~\cite{achiam2023gpt4} and MLLM~\cite{team2024gemini} used.
Nonetheless, we highlight that \ours{} can benefit further from future advancements in LLM and MLLM backbones.
