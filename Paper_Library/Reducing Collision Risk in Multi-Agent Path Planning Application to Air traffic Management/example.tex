\title{Reducing Collision Risk in Multi-Agent Path Planning: Application to Air Traffic Management}
% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.
% NOTE: authors will be visible only in the camera-ready and preprint versions (i.e., when using the option 'final' or 'preprint'). 
% 	For the initial submission the authors will be anonymized.

\begin{abstract}
    To minimize collision risks in the multi-agent path planning problem with stochastic transition dynamics, we formulate a Markov decision process congestion game with a multi-linear congestion cost. Players within the game complete individual tasks while minimizing their own collision risks. We show that the set of Nash equilibria  coincides with the first order KKT points of a non-convex optimization problem. Our game is applied to a historical flight plan over France to reduce collision risks between commercial aircraft.

\section{Conclusion}
We derived an $N$-player MDP congestion game in which players solve MDPs that are coupled to the opponents through collision risk. We showed that its Nash equilibria are the KKT points of a potential minimization problem, and applied our model to collision risk reduction for commercial aircraft under operational uncertainty. Future work includes analyzing effect on flight delays.  
% Future work includes analyzing the effect on flight delays and incorporating additional aircraft separation constraints.
