This paper explores multi-agent systems and identify challenges that remain inadequately addressed. By leveraging the diverse capabilities and roles of individual agents, multi-agent systems can tackle complex tasks through agent collaboration. We discuss optimizing task allocation, fostering robust reasoning through iterative debates, managing complex and layered context information, and enhancing memory management to support the intricate interactions within multi-agent systems. We also explore potential applications of multi-agent systems in blockchain systems to shed light on their future development and application in real-world distributed systems.

\section{Introduction}

Multi-agent systems enhance the capabilities of single LLM agents by leveraging collaborations among agents and their specialized abilities%, thus can complete tasks that exceed the capabilities of individual agents
~\cite{talebirad2023multi,zhang2023exploring,park2023generative,li2023camel,jinxin2023cgmi}. It utilizing collaboration and coordination among agents to execute tasks that are beyond the capability of any individual agent. 
In multi-agent systems, each agent is equipped with distinctive capabilities and roles, collaborating towards the fulfillment of some common objectives. Such collaboration, characterized by activities such as debate and reflection, has proven particularly effective for tasks requiring deep thought and innovation. 
Recent works include simulating interactive environments~\cite{park2023generative,jinxin2023cgmi}, role-playing~\cite{li2023camel}, reasoning~\cite{du2023debate,liang2023encouraging}, demonstrating the huge potential of multi-agent systems in handling complex real-world scenarios.



While existing works have demonstrated the impressive capabilities of multi-agent systems, the potential for advanced multi-agent systems far exceeds the progress made to date. A large number of existing works focus on devising planning strategies within a single agent by breaking down the tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks~\cite{chen2022program,ziqi-lu-2023-tab,yao2023tree,long2023large,besta2023graph,wang2022rationale}. 
Yet, multi-agent systems involve agents of various specializations and more complex interactions and layered context information, which poses challenges to the designing of the work flow as well as the whole system. 
Also, existing literature pays limited attention to memory storage, while memory plays a critical role in collaborations between agents. It enables agents to access to some common sense, aligning context with their tasks, 
and further, learn from past work flows and adapt their strategies accordingly. 

To date, multiple significant challenges that differentiate multi-agent systems and single-agent systems remain inadequately addressed. We summarize them as follows.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em, itemsep=-0.3em, topsep=0.3em]
    \item Optimizing task allocation to leverage agents' unique skills and specializations.
    \item Fostering robust reasoning through iterative debates or discussions among a subset of agents to enhance intermediate results.
    \item Managing complex and layered context information, such as context for overall tasks, single agents, and some common knowledge between agents, while ensuring alignment to the general objective.
    \item Managing various types of memory that serve for different objectives in coherent to the interactions in multi-agent systems 
\end{itemize}


This paper explores multi-agent systems, offering a survey of the existing works while shedding light on the challenges and open problems in it. We study major components in multi-agent systems, including planning and memory storage, and address unique challenges posed by multi-agent systems, compared with single-agent systems. We also explore potential application of multi-agent systems in blockchain systems from two perspectives, including 1) utilizing multi-agent systems as tools, and 2) assigning an agent to each blockchain node to make it represent the user, such that the agent can can complete some tasks on behalf of the user in the blockchain network.


\section{Overview}

\subsection{Structure of Multi-agent Systems}\label{sec: multi-agent-structure}

The structure of multi-agent systems can be categorized into various types, based on the each agent's functionality and their interactions. 
\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/agent_structure.pdf}
    \caption{Structures of multi-agent systems.}
    \label{fig:agent_structure}
\end{figure*}

\textbf{Equi-Level Structure.}
LLM agents in an equi-level system operate at the same hierarchical level, 
where each agent has its role and strategy, but neither holds a hierarchical advantage over the other, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., DMAS~\cite{chen2023scalable}; see \cref{fig:agent_structure}(a). The agents in such systems can have same, neutral, or opposing objectives. 
Agents with same goals collaborate towards a common goal without a centralized leadership. The emphasis is on collective decision-making and shared responsibilities~\cite{li2019multi}. 
With opposing objectives, the agents negotiate or debate to convince the others or achieve some final solutions~\cite{terekhov2023second,du2023debate,liang2023encouraging,chan2023chateval}.  %presents a system with an attacker agent and a defender agent, without one intermediary. \qz{what does this mean?} The defender possesses some secret information, the attacker is curious information, and the intermediary is neutral. Another example~\cite{du2023debate} is to leverage multiple agents to debate their individual reasoning processes to improve the quality of the generated content. 


\textbf{Hierarchical Structure.}
Hierarchical structures~\cite{survey_multi_agent_deep_learning,ahilan2019feudal} typically consists of a leader and one or multiple followers; see \cref{fig:agent_structure}(b). The leader's role is to guide or plan, while the followers respond or execute based on the leader's instructions. Hierarchical structures are prevalent in scenarios where coordinated efforts directed by a central authority are essential. 
Multi-agent systems that explore Stackelberg games~\citep{von2010market,conitzer2006computing} fall into this category~\citep{harris2023stackelberg}. This type of game is distinguished by this leadership-followership dynamic and the sequential nature of decision-making. 
Agents make decisions in a sequential order, where 
the leader player first generate an output (\textit{e}.\textit{g}., instructions) then the follower players take an
action based on the leader's instruction. 



\textbf{Nested Structure.}
Nested structures, or hybrid structures, constitute sub-structures of equi-level structures and/or hierarchical structures in a same multi-agent system~\cite{chan2023chateval}; see \cref{fig:agent_structure}(c).
The ``big picture'' of the system can be either equi-level or hierarchical, however, as some agents have to handle complex tasks, they  break down the tasks into small ones and construct a sub-system, either equi-level or hierarchical, and ``invite'' several agents to help with those tasks. 
In such systems, the interplay between different levels of hierarchy and peer-to-peer interaction contributes to complexity. Also, the interaction among those different structures can lead to intricate dynamics, where strategies and responses become complicated due to the presence of various influencing factors, including external elements like context or environment.


\textbf{Dynamic Structure.}
Dynamic structures mean that the states of the multi-agent system, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., the role of agents, their relations, and the number of agents in the multi-agent system, may change~\cite{talebirad2023multi} over time. As an example, ~\cite{talebirad2023multi} enables addition and removal of agents to make the system to suit the tasks at hand. 
% certain agent pairs or groups may turn to adversarial at certain time, while others remain cooperative. 
A multi-agent system may also be contextually adaptive, with the interaction patterns inside the system being modified based on internal system states or external factors, such as contexts. Agents in such systems can dynamically reconfigure their roles and relationships in response to changing conditions.


\subsection{Overview of Challenges in Multi-Agent Systems}
This paper surveys various components of multi-agent systems and discusses the challenges compared with single-agent systems. We discuss planning, memory management, as well as potential applications of multi-agent systems on distributed systems, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., blockchain systems.

\textbf{Planning.  }
In a single-agent system, planning involves the LLM agent  breaking down large tasks into a sequence of small, manageable tasks to achieve specific goals efficiently while enhancing interpretability, controllability, and flexibility~\cite{li2024personal,zhang2023igniting,nye2021show,wei2022chain}.
The agent can also learn to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), or connect LLMs with websites, software, and tools~\cite{patil2023gorilla,zhou2023webarena,cai2023large} to help reasoning and improve performance. While agents in a multi-agent system have same capabilities with single-agent systems, they encounter challenges inherited from the work flow in multi-agent systems. In \S\ref{sec: planning}, we discuss partitioning work flow and allocating the sub-tasks to agents; we name this process as ``global planning''; see \S\ref{sec: global_planning}. We then discuss task decomposition in each single-agent. Different from planning in a single-agent systems, agents in multi-agent systems must deal with more sophisticated contexts to reach alignment inside the multi-agent system, and further, achieve consistency towards the overall objective; see \S\ref{sec: single_agent_planning}.

\textbf{Memory management. }
Memory management in single-agent systems include short-term memory during a conversation, long-term memory that store historical conversations, and, if any, external data storage that serves as a complementary information source for inferences, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., RAG~\cite{rag}. Memory management in multi-agent systems must handle complex context data and sophisticated interaction and history information, thus requires advanced design for memories. We classify the memories involved in multi-agent systems in \S\ref{sec: memory_classification} and then discuss potential challenges posed by the sophisticated structure of memory in \S\ref{sec: memory_challenges}.

\textbf{Application. }
We discuss applications of multi-agent systems in blockchain, a distributed system that involves sophisticated design of layers and applications. Basically, multi-agent systems can serve as a tool due to its ability to handle sophisticated tasks in blockchain; see \S\ref{sec: mas_tool_in_blockchain}. Blockchain can also be integrated with multi-agent systems due to their distributed nature, where an intelligent agent can be allocated to an blockchain node to perform sophisticated actions, such as negotiations, on  behalf of the agent; see \S\ref{sec: blockchain_nodes_as_agents}.
