\section{HetGPS Under Adversarial Initial Conditions}
\label{app:adverseinitializations}

To evaluate the robustness of HetGPS to initialization, we repeated the Softmax experiment in Multi-Goal-Capture (Fig. 5a) with adverse initialization. We initialized the outer aggregator $U$ with $\tau=5$ (making it convex) and the inner aggregator $T$ with $\tau=-5$ (making it concave), which is the opposite of the concave-convex configuration predicted by theory to maximize heterogeneity gain.

As shown in Table~\ref{tab:adverse_init}, HetGPS successfully overcomes the adverse initialization and converges towards the theoretically optimal parameters (large positive $\tau$ for T, large negative $\tau$ for U).
