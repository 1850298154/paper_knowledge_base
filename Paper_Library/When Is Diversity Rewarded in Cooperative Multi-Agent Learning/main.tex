\begin{abstract}
The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation for \emph{when} such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing on multi-agent task allocation problems, we study this question from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation operators: an \emph{inner} operator that maps the \(N\) agents’ effort allocations on individual tasks to a task score, and an \emph{outer} operator that merges the \(M\) task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask what incentivizes heterogeneity to \textit{emerge} when embodied, time-extended agents must \emph{learn} an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational paradigm, and introduce \emph{Heterogeneity Gain Parameter Search (HetGPS)}, a gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.  Across different environments, we show that HetGPS rediscovers the reward regimes predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both validating HetGPS and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity delivers a measurable benefit.

% \begin{abstract}
% While behavioral diversity is often considered advantageous in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly for cooperative settings requiring role specialization, its practical implementation can introduce significant computational overhead that hinders learning. 
% Therefore, understanding which types of tasks genuinely necessitate and benefit from behavioral heterogeneity is crucial for efficient MARL design. 
% We investigate this question from the lens of \textit{co-design}, investigating which aspects of a task or environment can be tuned to either create or eliminate an advantage for heterogeneous agents. 
% We focus on multi-task environments where the reward structure depends on agents' effort allocation. We model the global reward as the sum of two generalized aggregators: 
% an \textit{inner} aggregator that maps agent efforts within each task to a task score, and an \textit{outer} aggregator that combines the resulting task scores. We then prove that the \textit{curvature}--specifically the \textit{Schur-concavity} or \textit{Schur-convexity}--of these aggregation functions determines the performance advantage of heterogeneous agents over homogeneous ones. For broad classes of reward structures, these conditions simplify to simple convexity/concavity tests, potentially offering researchers insights into when to leverage agent heterogeneity. For scenarios not covered by our theoretical analysis, we introduce \emph{Heterogeneity Gain Parameter Search (HetGPS)}, an algorithm that optimizes MARL environment parameters in underspecified tasks to identify settings where behavioral heterogeneity is advantageous.  Experiments in embodied \capturetheflag and matrix games validate our theory and demonstrate HetGPS as a valuable tool for studying the relation between agent diversity and task performance.

% \subsubsection*{Reproducibility Statement}

% Our supplementary material contains the source code we used to produce all results in this work, including the code used to train the agents, our implementation of HetGPS, and the code used to produce all plots in the paper (see Appendix \ref{app:code_details}). The \texttt{readme} contains detailed instructions on how to use this code. All mathematical claims made in this work are fully proven in the Appendix, and our assumptions are described in detail in Section \ref{sec:problemsetting} (``Problem Setting'').  Appendices \ref{app:adverseinitializations} and \ref{app:stability_of_bilevel_optimization} addresses potential questions readers may have regarding the stability of the bilevel optimization process used in HetGPS and similar environment design algorithms in the literature. Finally, Appendix \ref{appendix:limitations} addresses the assumptions and scope of our work, and outlines some remaining open questions.


% It is important that the work published in ICLR is reproducible. Authors are strongly encouraged to include a paragraph-long Reproducibility Statement at the end of the main text (before references) to discuss the efforts that have been made to ensure reproducibility. This paragraph should not itself describe details needed for reproducing the results, but rather reference the parts of the main paper, appendix, and supplemental materials that will help with reproducibility. For example, for novel models or algorithms, a link to an anonymous downloadable source code can be submitted as supplementary materials; for theoretical results, clear explanations of any assumptions and a complete proof of the claims can be included in the appendix; for any datasets used in the experiments, a complete description of the data processing steps can be provided in the supplementary materials. Each of the above are examples of things that can be referenced in the reproducibility statement. This optional reproducibility statement is not part of the main text and therefore will not count toward the page limit.

\section{Computational Resources Used}
\label{appendix:computeused}
For the realization of this work, we have employed computational resources that have gone towards: experiment design, prototyping, and running final experiment results.
Simulation and training are both run on GPUs, no CPU compute has been used. Results have been stored on the WANDB cloud service.
We estimate:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  300 compute hours on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU. 
    \item  500 compute hours on an NVIDIA L40S GPU.
\end{itemize}

Simply reproucing our results using the available code will take considerably less compute hours (around a day).

\section{Code and Data Availability}
\label{appendix:code_availability}

We attach the code in the supplementary materials.
The code contains instructions on how to reproduce the experiments in the paper and dedicated YAML files containing the hyperparameters for each experiment presented. The YAML files are structured according to the HYDRA~\citep{yadan2019hydra} framework which allows smooth reproduction as well as systematic and standardized configuration. We further attach all scripts to reproduce the plots in the paper from the experiment results.

\section{Implementation Details}
\label{app:code_details}
For all experiments, we use the MAPPO MARL algorithm~\citep{yu2022surprising}.
Environments are implemented in the multi-agent environment simulator VMAS~\citep{bettini2022vmas}, and trained using TorchRL~\citep{boutorchrl}. Both the actor and critic are two-layer MLPs with 256 neurons per layer and Tanh activation. Further details, such as hyperparameter choices, are available in the attached code and YAML configuration files.

Experiments were run on a single Nvidia L40 GPU. In the HetGPS experiments (\autoref{sec:HetGPS}), a standard MARL training iteration (60,000 frames) takes approx. 15s; including the environment backpropagation increases this to approximately 20s.

\section{Use of LLMs}
\label{appendix:useofllms}
We used LLMs (ChatGPT 4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) to improve some parts of the writing, e.g., make wording suggestions. We verified and take responsibility for all LLM-related outputs in this work.

\section{Parametrized Dec-POMDP}
\label{app:pdecpomdp}
A Parametrized Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (PDec-POMDP) is defined as a tuple
$$\left \langle \mathcal{N}, \mathcal{S}, \left \{ \mathcal{O}_i \right \}_{i \in \mathcal{N}}, \left \{ \sigma_i^\theta \right \}_{i \in \mathcal{N}},  \left \{ \mathcal{A}_i \right \}_{i \in \mathcal{N}}, \mathcal{R}^\theta , \mathcal{T}^\theta, \gamma, s_0^\theta \right \rangle_\theta,$$
where $\mathcal{N} = \{1,\ldots, n\}$ denotes the set of agents,
$\mathcal{S}$ is the state space, and,
$\left \{ \mathcal{O}_i \right \}_{i \in \mathcal{N}}$ and
$\left \{ \mathcal{A}_i \right \}_{i \in \mathcal{N}}$
are the observation and action spaces, with $\mathcal{O}_i \subseteq \mathcal{S}, \; \forall i \in \mathcal{N}$. 
Further, $\left \{ \sigma_i^\theta \right \}_{i \in \mathcal{N}}$ 
and
$\mathcal{R}^\theta $
are the agent observation and reward functions, such that
$\sigma_i^\theta : \mathcal{S} \mapsto \mathcal{O}_i$, and,
$\mathcal{R}^\theta: \mathcal{S} \times \left \{ \mathcal{A}_i \right \}_{i \in \mathcal{N}} \mapsto \R$.
$\mathcal{T}^\theta$ is the stochastic state transition model, defined as $\mathcal{T}^\theta : \mathcal{S} \times \left \{ \mathcal{A}_i \right \}_{i \in \mathcal{N}}   \mapsto  \Delta\mathcal{S}$, which outputs the probability $\mathcal{T}^\theta(s^t, \left \{ a^t_i \right \}_{i \in \mathcal{N}},s^{t+1})$ of transitioning to state $s^{t+1} \in \mathcal{S}$ given the current state $s^t \in \mathcal{S}$ and actions $\left \{ a^t_i \right \}_{i \in \mathcal{N}}$, with $a^t_i \in \mathcal{A}_i$. $\gamma$ is the discount factor.
Finally, $s_0^\theta \in \mathcal{S}$ is a the initial environment state.
A PDec-POMDP represents a set of traditional Dec-POMDPs~\citep{oliehoek2016concise}, where the observation function, the transition function, the reward function, and the initial state are conditioned on parameters $\theta$. This formalism is similar to the concepts of Underspecified POMDP~\citep{dennis2020emergent} and contextual MDP~\citep{modi2018markov}.

Agents are equipped with (possibly stochastic) policies $\pi_{i}(a_i|o_i)$, which compute an action given a local observation. 
Their objective is to maximize the discounted return:
$$
G^\theta(\mathbf{\pi}) = \mathbb{E}_\mathbf{\pi}\left [\sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t\mathcal{R}^\theta\left (s^t,\mathbf{a}^t \right ) \middle \vert s^{t+1} \sim \mathcal{T}^\theta(s^t,\mathbf{a}^t), a_i^t \sim \pi_i(o_i^t), o_i^t = \sigma^\theta_i(s_t)  \right ],
$$
where $\mathbf{\pi}, \mathbf{a}$ are the vectors of all agents' policies and actions. 
$G^\theta(\mathbf{\pi})$ represents the expected sum of discounted rewards starting in state $s_0^\theta$ and following policy $\mathbf{\pi}$ in a PDec-POMDP parametrized by $\theta$.

% \section*{NeurIPS Paper Checklist}

% % %%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
% % The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research, addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove the checklist: {\bf The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.} The checklist should follow the references and follow the (optional) supplemental material.  The checklist does NOT count towards the page
% % limit. 

% % Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For each question in the checklist:
% % \begin{itemize}
% %     \item You should answer \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
% %     \item \answerNA{} means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the relevant information is Not Available.
% %     \item Please provide a short (1–2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA). 
% %    % \item {\bf The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.}
% % \end{itemize}

% % {\bf The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission.} They are visible to the reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it (after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be publisHetGPS with the paper.

% % The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation. While "\answerYes{}" is generally preferable to "\answerNo{}", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "\answerNo{}" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering "\answerNo{}" or "\answerNA{}" is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer \answerYes{} to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

% % IMPORTANT, please:
% % \begin{itemize}
% %     \item {\bf Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading ``NeurIPS Paper Checklist"},
% %     \item  {\bf Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.}
% %     \item {\bf Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers}.
% % \end{itemize} 
 

% % %%% END INSTRUCTIONS %%%


% \begin{enumerate}

% \item {\bf Claims}
%     \item[] Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerYes{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: Sections \autoref{sec:intro} and \autoref{sec:problemsetting} explain the scope. Each claim made in the introduction is provided alongside a reference to the relevant section in the paper.
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
%         \item The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. 
%         \item The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. 
%         \item It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper. 
%     \end{itemize}

% \item {\bf Limitations}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerYes{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \autoref{sec:intro} and \autoref{sec:problemsetting} bound the scope of this work. The Discussion brings up open questions, and 
%     \autoref{appendix:limitations} extensively discusses limitations, and more open questions.
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. 
%         \item The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
%         \item The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
%         \item The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
%         \item The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
%         \item The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
%         \item If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
%         \item While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
%     \end{itemize}

% \item {\bf Theory assumptions and proofs}
%     \item[] Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerYes{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: Please find all proofs in the Appendix.
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. 
%         \item All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
%         \item All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
%         \item The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. 
%         \item Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
%         \item Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced. 
%     \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Experimental result reproducibility}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerYes{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: The code is provided in the supplementary material alongside YAML configuration files that enable one to re-run our experiments exactly (\autoref{appendix:code_availability}), while all technical derivations are in the paper body or in the Appendix.
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%         \item If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
%         \item If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. 
%         \item Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplisHetGPS in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
%         \item While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
%         \begin{enumerate}
%             \item If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
%             \item If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
%             \item If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
%             \item We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
%         \end{enumerate}
%     \end{itemize}


% \item {\bf Open access to data and code}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerYes{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: The code for generating all our results can be found in the supplementary materials.
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
%         \item Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (\url{https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy}) for more details.
%         \item While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
%         \item The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (\url{https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy}) for more details.
%         \item The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
%         \item The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
%         \item At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
%         \item Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
%     \end{itemize}


% \item {\bf Experimental setting/details}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerYes{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: The code contains instructions on how to reproduce the experiments in the paper and dedicated YAML files containing the hyperparameters for each experiment presented. The YAML files are structured according to the HYDRA~\citep{yadan2019hydra} framework which allows smooth reproduction as well as systematic and standardized configuration. We further attach all scripts to reproduce the plots in the paper from the experiment results.
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%         \item The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
%         \item The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
%     \end{itemize}

% \item {\bf Experiment statistical significance}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
%     \item[] Answer:\answerYes{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: For every result presented, we report mean and standard deviation bars over various random seeds.
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%         \item The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
%         \item The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
%         \item The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
%         \item The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
%         \item It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
%         \item It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96\% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
%         \item For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
%         \item If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
%     \end{itemize}

% \item {\bf Experiments compute resources}
%     \item[] Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerYes{}
%     \item[] Justification: We provide details on the computational resources used in the supplementary material (Appendix \ref{appendix:computeused}).
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%         \item The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
%         \item The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. 
%         \item The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper). 
%     \end{itemize}
    
% \item {\bf Code of ethics}
%     \item[] Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics \url{https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines}?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerYes{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: The paper is theoretical, does not use sensitive data, and does not violate anything in the Code of Ethics.
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
%         \item If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
%         \item The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
%     \end{itemize}


% \item {\bf Broader impacts}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerNA{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: Given the topic of the paper (heterogeneity in multi-agent learning), this question is likely not applicable.
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
%         \item If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
%         \item Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
%         \item The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
%         \item The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
%         \item If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
%     \end{itemize}
    
% \item {\bf Safeguards}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerNA{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: We present no data or models at risk of misuse.
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
%         \item Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. 
%         \item Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
%         \item We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
%     \end{itemize}

%     \item[] Answer: \answerNA{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: Paper does not involve crowdsourcing or human subjects.
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
%         \item Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. 
%         \item According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
